  """REPLAY-EVENTS reprocesses the events collected (see @COLLECT)
  in TRIAL. It takes the same arguments as TRY except
  [DEBUG][argument], [COUNT][argument] and RERUN. This is because
  REPLAY-EVENTS does not run any tests. It simply signals the events
  collected in TRIAL again to allow further processing. The values of
  *CATEGORIES* and *COUNT* that were in effect for TRIAL are used, and
  their current values are ignored to be able to keep consistent
  counts (see @COUNT).

  Suppose we ran a large test using the default `:PRINT` and into a
  rare non-deterministic bug.

  ```cl-transcript (:dynenv try-transcript)
  (deftest some-test ()
    (with-test (inner)
      (is t)
      (is (= 10 7))   ; fake non-deterministic bug
      (is t))
    (error "my-msg"))

  (try 'some-test)
  ```

  Now, the output is too large with EXPECTED events and the backtrace
  cluttering it. We could try running the test again with different
  settings, or even just [rerunning][@rerun] it, but that might make
  the bug go away. Instead of searching for the interesting bits in
  the text output, we can replay the events and print only the
  UNEXPECTED events:

  ```cl-transcript (:dynenv try-transcript)
  (let ((*print-backtrace* nil))
    (replay-events ! :print 'unexpected))
  .. SOME-TEST
  ..   INNER
  ..     ⊠ (IS (= 10 7))
  ..   ⊠ INNER ⊠1 ⋅2
  ..   ⊟ "my-msg" (SIMPLE-ERROR)
  .. ⊟ SOME-TEST ⊟1 ⊠1 ⋅2
  ..
  ==> #<TRIAL (SOME-TEST) ABORT* 0.500s ⊟1 ⊠1 ⋅2>
  ```

  Now, we decide that nesting of test is unimportant here, change to
  new printer settings and replay:

  ```cl-transcript (:dynenv try-transcript)
  (let ((*print-backtrace* nil)
        (*print-parent* nil)
        (*print-compactly* t)
        (*defer-describe* t))
    (replay-events !))
  .. ⊠⊟
  .. ⊟ SOME-TEST ⊟1 ⊠1 ⋅2
  ..
  .. ;; UNEXPECTED-RESULT-FAILURE (⊠) in SOME-TEST INNER:
  .. (IS (= 10 7))
  ..
  .. ;; UNHANDLED-ERROR (⊟) in SOME-TEST:
  .. "my-msg" (SIMPLE-ERROR)
  ..
  ==> #<TRIAL (SOME-TEST) ABORT* 0.500s ⊟1 ⊠1 ⋅2>
  ```
