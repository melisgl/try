  "Try TESTABLE and display its output in a buffer
with minor mode `mgl-try-mode'.

The TESTABLE argument
---------------------

The TESTABLE argument is a string. It defaults to the symbol
under point or, in `mgl-try-mode', to the name of the innermost
global test that contains the current line. If it's the empty
string, then `mgl-try' switches to the buffer \"*try*\" if it
exists. Else, TESTABLE is CL:READ and CL:EVALuated to produce a
testable object (see TRY::@TESTABLES), which is then passed to
TRY:TRY.

To try a single function, TESTABLE may simply be its name:

  foo

Apart from this convenience feature, TESTABLE is evaluated
normally. Examples:

  (find-package 'foo-test)

  \'(foo bar)

  \'foo (same as the convenicence shorthand `foo' above)

Prefix arg
----------

- With no prefix arg, the parameters for an TRY::@EXPLICIT-TRY
  are used. With the default value of TRY:*TRY-DEBUG* being NIL,
  this will not enter the debugger.

- With a prefix arg, the parameters for an TRY::@IMPLICIT-TRY are
  used. With the  default value of TRY:*DEBUG*,  this is suitable
  for interactive debugging.

Record context
--------------

When `mgl-try' is invoked and the \"*try*\" buffer does not
exist, TRY:*RECORD-CONTEXT* will be used, and the resulting
TRY:TRIAL object will be the Emacs record context as long as that
buffer exists or until being superseded by a call to
`mgl-rerun-all'. Clarifications:

- The global binding of TRY:*RECORD-CONTEXT* is inherited at the
  first invocation, but TRY:*RECORD-CONTEXT* itself is never
  changed.

- As long as the \"*try*\" buffer exists, all invocations of
  `mgl-try', `mgl-try-rerun' and `mgl-try-rerun-all' will use the
  Emacs record context regardless of whether they are invoked in
  the \"*try*\" buffer or elsewhere. If that's no longer desired,
  just kill the buffer (bound to \"q\").

CL variables
------------

To ensure that the output is parsable by Elisp, the following
Common Lisp variables are overridden:

- All trials are collected. That is, TRY:*COLLECT* and
  TRY:*TRY-COLLECT* (in implicit and explicit modes) are set to
  TRIAL-EVENT.

- TRY:*TRY-PRINTER* and TRY:*PRINTER* are set to TRY:TREE-PRINTER,

- TRY:*PRINT-PARENT* to T,

- TRY:*PRINT-INDENTATION* to :OUTLINE,

- TRY:*PRINT-COMPACTLY* to NIL,

- TRY:*DEFER-DESCRIBE* to NIL.

- TRY:*CATEGORIES* to TRY:FANCY-STD-FAILURE (with a small
  modification to print UNEXPECTED-VERDICT-FAILUREs with the
  marker \"→⊠\". This is because their failure is a consequence
  of other failures, and this way `mgl-try-mode-next-unexpected'
  skips over them.

Other variables not listed here (such as TRY:*PRINT-BACKTRACE*,
TRY:*DEBUG*, TRY:*TRY-DEBUG*) are in effect."
